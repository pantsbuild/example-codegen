# example-codegen

An example repository to demonstrate codegen support in Pants. 

Refer to these docs for more information:

* [Python Protobuf](https://www.pantsbuild.org/docs/protobuf-python)
* [Python Thrift](https://www.pantsbuild.org/docs/thrift-python)

Some commands you can try out:

* `./pants export-codegen ::` - see the generated files.
    * This isn't necessary for Pants to use the generated files, but can be useful when
      debugging or to generate files for IDEs.
* `./pants test ::` - run all tests
* `./pants fmt ::` - format Protobuf with `buf`
* `./pants lint ::` - lint Protobuf with `buf`
* `./pants dependencies <path/to/file>` - see what depends on what

Check out our other [example repositories](https://www.pantsbuild.org/docs/example-repos) to see 
other features like packaging binaries.
